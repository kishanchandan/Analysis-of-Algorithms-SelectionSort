Analysis-of-Algorithms Simple Selection Sorts

In the first part of the problem you will implement the simple selection sort algorithm. You can use an array to store the elements.  

 
a. As you are aware the selection sort algorithm runs in O(n2) time.  Implement your algorithm in a separate function called SelectionSort(). 
 
Sample Test Cases Input: 4, 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 10, 3, 9, 2 Output: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 22 
 
b. In the second part of the assignment you will modify the selection sort algorithm to obtain the first k smallest elements of the array in sorted order (the value of k will be entered by the user). Your algorithm must run in O(nk) time.  Sample Test Case 1 Input: 4, 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 10, 3, 9, 2 k = 4 Output: 2, 3, 4, 6 
 
Sample Test Case 2 Input: 4, 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 10, 3, 9, 2 k = 6 Output: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
